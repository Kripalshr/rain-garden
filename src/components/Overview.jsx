            A rain garden is a shallow, landscaped area designed to manage
            stormwater runoff from surfaces like streets, roofs, and driveways.
            It is planted with deep-rooted native plants and grasses that absorb
            and filter water.

            Rain gardens are an essential part of making Kathmandu more
            resilient to climate change and improving its urban sustainability:

              <span className="font-semibold">Manage Stormwater Runoff:</span>{" "}
              Kathmandu experiences intense rainfall during the monsoon season,
              often leading to flash floods and waterlogging. Rain gardens help
              absorb excess water from streets, roofs, and driveways, reducing
              the pressure on drainage systems and preventing flooding.

            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">More Green Spaces:</span> As the
              city grows, there is an increasing need for green spaces. Rain
              gardens, planted with native plants, provide environmental
              benefits such as enhancing biodiversity, creating urban green
              spaces, improving air quality, and reducing the urban heat island
              effect.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span className="font-semibold">Reduce Flooding:</span> With
              Kathmandu's rapid urbanization and impermeable surfaces, water
              drainage has become a challenge. Rain gardens help slow down and
              filter stormwater, reducing the likelihood of flooding in
              low-lying areas. This sustainable approach is a vital tool for
              managing the cityâ€™s flood risk.
